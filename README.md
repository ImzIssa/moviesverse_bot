# a bot that downloads movies from moviesverse.biz
uses chrome brower

# requires chromedrivers depending on your current version of chrome

# uses the following libraries:
--selenium
--beautifulSoup
--requests 

## code works but is not efficient 

# future plans include making code object oriented, fast and be able to download from tfpdl
